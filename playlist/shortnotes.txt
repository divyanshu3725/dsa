----------------------------------------------------------
give me a detailed explanation on how is c++ code compiled
----------------------------------------------------------
PREPROCESSOR
- takes code 
- gives preprocessed code 
- header files are included
- macros are expanded
COMPILER 
- takes preprocessed code or HLSC 
- gives assembler code 
- syntax and semantic analysis is done
ASSEMBLER 
- takes assembly code 
- gives object file 
- object files contain machine code
- machine code is architecture specific 
- LINKING 
- takes all the object file 
- gives executable fil
- resolves references between object files
- static linking and dynamic linking
LOADER 
- loads executable file into memory
CPU 
- executes the program
